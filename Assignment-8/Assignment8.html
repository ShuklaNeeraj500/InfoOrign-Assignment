<!--Basically, this is a puzzle, and as we know that every puzzle has a specific pattern 
	to decode it, the same is here.

	In this puzzle, we will get different results for " who will survive" question, 
	for the different number of soldiers chosen.
  1)
 	So after doing some research I found that whenever the number of soldiers is equal
 	to a number which is a perfect power of 2, the result will be [OR] the survivor will be
 	the first soldier(or we can say the soldier which is having the sword for the First).

 	for example, if no. of soldiers is 2,4,8,16,32,64,128, etc i.e 2^n .The result will 
 	always be the first soldier i.e. the soldier having the Sword for the first.
 2)
 	But what if the number of Soldiers is not equal to a number which is a perfect power 
 	of 2 for Example 100, 50, 78, 230, etc. 
	The great thing is that it's also having a pattern, for explaining it I have to take
	an example. And in the example, No. of soldiers is 100 and the sword position is 1 
	i.e. its in the hand of soldier which is in position 1.

	As 100 is not a perfect power of 2, So now we will find the largest number 
	(which is a perfect  Power of 2 [i.e. 2^n] ) but it is less than 100. 
	And that number is 64 i.e. 2^6.

	Now the remaining soldiers will be 100 -64 = 36.
	now assigning these values into the variables, 

	let A= the position of a soldier who will survive at last, in the 100 soldiers
    and L=36(the remaining ones)

	Now the pattern says that:) A = 1+2L will give the desired output.

	After putting value we get A= 1+ (2*36) ; 
	A=73, which is the Answer,
	------------So the soldier in the 73rd position will survive.-----------

	***********And the same is true for every number which is not a perfect power of 2.************

	<!-- But this  PATTERN WORKS FINE ****[ONLY WHEN]**** the sword is in 1st position but if we
	 want the sword to be in ****[ANY POSITION]**** we have to follow a way consisting of an array.
	 And by manupulating that array we can get the desired result of ****[Who will survive 
	 at last]**** question.
	
	for further detail about this array manupulation see the ****[Section-4]**** in the below code.

   <!-- -----------Let me Run you through my code------------------->

	 <!--
	 section 1:-This is the CSS Style.

	 section 2:-This is the HTML section.

	 section 3:-This is the Internal JavaScript section which Provides us the result.It is having 
	 			various If Else conditon that will check which Soldier will Survive at last.

	 section 4:-This portion of Code don't use the pattern to find the result , BECAUSE PATTERN 
	 			FAILS when Sword is not in the 1st position and is in some other Position.
	 			This portion uses Array MANUPULATION to get the desired result.
